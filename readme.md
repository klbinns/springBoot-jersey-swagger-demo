Demo project to show integration between Spring Boot, Jersey 2, and Swagger2/Swagger UI

This has been difficult since there needed some massaging to make Spring Boot, Jersey and Swagger IO's reference implementation to work together.

Perhaps using Spring Boot, Spring MVC and Springfox's Swagger implementation (+UI) will be easier.
